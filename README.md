### WooCommerce Direct Payment Gateway For Novatti/Decta

This should work better than the provided WooCommerce plugin for Novatti Payments, or other Decta partners.
This is probably best used as a general idea to roll your own plugin as some parts are specific to our website.

With this plugin, the user is never redirected away from your website, and they enter card credentials directly on the checkout page. A valid SSL certificate is necessary.

Public and private keys can be added in WooCommerce -> Settings -> Nimbus Gateway.
